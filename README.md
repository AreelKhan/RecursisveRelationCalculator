# RecursisveRelationCalculator
A calculator that produces the first n terms of a recursive relation and plots these values.
While studying calculus I often needed to plot or visulaize a recursive relation.
However, I could not find any resources on the internet to help. So I decided to code one myself.
Although this still needs some work, it is functional enough to fulfill its purpose.
